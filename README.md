# Community Project – Women Techsters Fellowship
This is an ongoing solo project I am currently building as part of the Women Techsters Fellowship.

## File Structure
- components  (Hold single self contained piece of UI)
- modules (Holds collection of components/single feature)

## How to Import
To import any module or component (its HTML file), use a data attribute:
```html 
<div data-import="./component/example/example.html"></div>
```

Use relative paths when referencing modules or components.
